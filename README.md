# FLAT - PyMOL Script Collection

_FLAT_ is personal collection of scripts and utilities for PyMOL molecular visualizer. The inspiration behind the library is to learn how to work with PyMOL and create a collection of useful functions for easy and convenient use. It is heavily inspired and borrows (_shamelessly steals_) code from [Pymol ScrIpt COllection (PSICO)](https://github.com/speleo3/pymol-psico).

## Installation

In you python environment move into flat directory and run: 

```bash
pip install .
```

To activate all _FLAT_ commands in PyMOL, add this to your `~/.pymolrc.py` file or add it in PyMOL under `File` â†’ `Edit pymolrc`:

```python
import flat.fullinit
```
